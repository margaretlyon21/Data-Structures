# Lab-3---Classes-Multifile-programs-and-operator-overloading

The objective of this Lab is to create a class including constructors, using correct class file separation and implement operator overloading.

These objectives were accomplished by creating a custom measument class containing littles, lots, and heaps, with overloaded operators allowing the measurements to be algebraicly defined with custom behaviors.
